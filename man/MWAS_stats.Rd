\description{
This function tests for association between individual metabolites and a disease
phenotype.}
\usage{
MWAS_stats (metabo_SE, disease_id, confounder_ids = NULL, assoc_method, mt_method = "BH",
            output = "pvalues", CV_metabo = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{metabo_SE}{SummarizedExperiment object generated using the function
  "MWAS_SummarizedExperiment()".}
  \item{disease_id}{character vector corresponding to the id of the response to be
  modeled.}
  \item{confounder_ids}{optional character vector corresponding to the ids of the
  covariates to be included in the model (e.g. age or gender).}
  \item{assoc_method}{character constant indicating the association method that
  will be used. Possible values for assoc_method are: "pearson" (Pearson correlation),
  "spearman" (Spearman correlation), "kendall" (Kendall correlation), "linear"
  (linear regression) or "logistic" (logistic regression).}
  \item{mt_method}{character constant indicating the multiple-testing correction
  method that will be used. Possible values for mt_method are: "BH" (Benjamini and
  Hochberg), "bonferroni", "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "BY" (Benjamini and Yekutieli),
  "qvalues", or "none".}
  \item{output}{character constant indicating the output of the function. If
  output = "pvalues", p-values and estimates for each metabolic variable will be
  returned as a matrix. If output = "models", detailed information about the
  statistical model fitted for each metabolic variable will be returned.}
  \item{CV_metabo}{optional numeric vector containing the coefficients of variation
  of the metabolic variables. This vector will be added as an additional column
  of the output matrix.}
}
\value{
By default, a matrix where each row contains the model coefficient estimate
and the p-value obtained for each metabolic variable. When output = "models", the
function returns a list, each list element containing detailed information about
the statistic model fitted for each metabolic variable.
