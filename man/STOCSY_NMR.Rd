\title{Statistical Total Correlation Spectroscopy - Academic use only}
\description{
This function calculates STOCSY between an NMR signal of interest and all the NMR
variables, representing a useful tool for NMR molecular identification and assignment.
The results are represented in a pseudo-NMR spectrum displaying the covariance (height)
and the Pearson correlation coefficient (color) of all spectral variables with the variable
of interest (driver signal).

\usage{
STOCSY_NMR (metabo_SE, ppm_query, alpha_th = 0.05, xlab = "ppm", ylab = "covariance",
            size_lab = 12, size_axis = 12, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, xbreaks = waiver(),
            xnames = waiver(), ynames = waiver(), ybreaks = waiver())
}
\arguments{
  \item{metabo_SE}{SummarizedExperiment object generated using the function
  "MWAS_SummarizedExperiment()".}
  \item{ppm_query}{numeric value (at least 2 decimals) corresponding to the driver ppm.}
  \item{alpha_th}{numeric value indicating the significance threshold. NMR variables
  with BH-adjusted p-value above this threshold will be neglected.}
  \item{xlab}{character vector specifying a title for the x-axis.}
  \item{ylab}{character vector specifying a title for the y-axis. }
  \item{size_lab}{numeric value indicating the font size of x- and y- axis titles.}
  \item{size_axis}{numeric value indicating the font size of x- and y- axis labels. }
  \item{xlim}{numeric vector containing the minimum and maximum values of the x-axis.
  Notice that ppm is displayed in reverse scale (e.g. xlim = c(2, 1)).}
  \item{ylim}{numeric vector containing the minimum and maximum values of the y-axis.}
  \item{xbreaks}{numeric vector indicating the positions of the breaks of the x-axis.}
  \item{xnames}{character vector (same length as xbreaks) containing the labels
  of each break of the x-axis.}
  \item{ybreaks}{numeric vector indicating the positions of the breaks of the y-axis.}
  \item{ynames}{character vector (same length as ybreaks) containing the labels
  of each break of the y-axis.}
}
\value{
A plot displaying the Pearson correlation coefficient (color) and covariance (height)
between all spectral variables and the driver signal.
