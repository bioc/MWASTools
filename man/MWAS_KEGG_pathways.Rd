\title{Map metabolites into KEGG pathways}
\description{
This function allows mapping the metabolites of interest detected by MWAS
analysis onto the KEGG pathways. The function also exports a network file and an
attribute file which can be imported into Cytoscape to visualize the results
as a pathway-based metabolic network.
}
\usage{
MWAS_KEGG_pathways(metabolites, MWAS_matrix = NULL, enrichment_test = FALSE,
                   mt_method = "bonferroni", file_name = "KeggPaths")
}
\arguments{
  \item{metabolites}{character vector containing the KEGG IDs of the metabolites
  of interest detected by MWAS. The order of the metabolite IDs in this vector must
  match the order in MWAS_matrix. Compound KEGG IDs can be obtained using the
  function "MS_FindKEGG()" from the MetaboSignal package.}
  \item{MWAS_matrix}{numeric matrix generated with the function "MWAS_stats()".
  It can also be a submatrix containing only the significant metabolites, generated
  with the function "MWAS_filter()". }
  \item{enrichment_test}{logical constant indicating whether pathway enrichment
  analysis will be performed.}
  \item{mt_method}{character string indicating the multiple-testing correction
  method used to correct the p-values from the enrichment analysis tests. To check
  all possible methods see "p.adjust()". This argument will be ignored if
  enrichment_test = FALSE}
  \item{file_name}{character vector that allows customizing the name of the
  exported files.}

\value{
A six-column matrix indicating the KEGG pathways where each metabolite was mapped.
The results are formatted as a six-column matrix containing the following
information: metabolite KEGG ID (column 1), metabolite name (column 2), pathway
KEGG ID (column 3), pathway name (column 4), pathway class (column 5), pathway
organism (i.e. "Human"/"Not_human") (column 6).

The function also exports a network file ("KeggPaths_NetworkFile.txt") and an
attribute file ("KeggPaths_AttributeFile.txt") that can be imported into
Cytoscape to visualize the results as a network. The attribute file allows
customizing the metabolites of interest based on a score reflecting the degree
of association with the phenotype under study (i.e. log10(pvalue) adjusted for
the sign of the association). If pathway enrichment analysis is performed, the
function also exports a file ("KeggPaths_EnrichmentAnalysis.txt") showing the
results of this analysis.
}
\details{
Pathway enrichment analysis of a given dataset is peformed by using all metabolites
reported in KEGG pathways as reference. The p-values are calculated using one-sided
Fisher's test.
